// Latejoin spawns must now have a bias for factions
// We'll have to add a new type of latejoin variable that also includes the faction.
// When joining, the game will check if the joining mob has a faction, if it does, it'll send it to a latejoin with a faction, if not, it'll send it 
// to a latejoin without a faction
