# Sunset Modular Folder

## All custom sprites, code and sounds should go here!
Keeping things clean and organized, and having our custom assets modular will allow for easier merging of any upstream changes.

## Mark your changes!
All modifications to non-Sunset files should be marked. A simple `//Sunset Edit - comment` will suffice.
