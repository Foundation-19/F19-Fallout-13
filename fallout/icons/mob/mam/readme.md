## MUTABLE APPEARANCES!

This folder is simply the main repository where we can store our mutable appearance sprites. This is to avoid any confusion on where our sprite accessories are stored. It's recommended if you are making something completely new, have it in it's own .dmi to avoid conflicting with main files we may want to use in the future, though, it doesn't matter much. Do what ever :)

To locate the code references these icons, it's safe to search via control shift F on VSCode.
- Firstly, right click the icon file you want to see wherei t's referenced in code. Click "Copy Relative Path" near the bottom of the context menu.
- Go into the search tab via Cntrl + Shift + F and enter it in the top bar.

It's a 50/50 which VSCode version you have, one will do / and the other will use \, if it's \, go and replace them with /.

- You can now see all the files which use this icon file, it's really useful to see if there may be a file in modular_coyote which you might not realise and you may need to fix some wing definitions there for example. Who knows!
